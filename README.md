# dpl.js (d3-plotlib)
(preliminary draft)
This library eliminates boilerplate code for setting up basic charts. Unlike  other frameworks, dpl.js does not provide bespoke charts by type, but delivers standard objects that can be combined in a custom fashion.   

See [the wiki](https://github.com/ZJONSSON/dpl/wiki) for more details.
